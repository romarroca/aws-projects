# WireGuard Cloud VPN on AWS

This project demonstrates how to build a secure VPN hub using WireGuard on an AWS EC2 instance.  
The VPN server acts as a cloud-based gateway, allowing remote devices and networks (e.g., my GL.iNet router) to connect securely without requiring a public IP at home.

## Features
- WireGuard server hosted on AWS (Ubuntu EC2 instance)
- Supports router and mobile clients
- Extensible for learning AWS networking and security concepts
